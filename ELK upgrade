ELK upgrade...!!!

for the upgrade we need to place the rpm file of logstash,es & kibana in /tmp or /etc

After that we have to take backup for /etc/elasticsearch  &  /etc/logstash  &  /etc/kibana with the below cmd
cd /etc/
cp logstash logstash_bkp
cp elasticsearch elascticsearch_bkp
cp kibana kibana_bkp

Then we need to take backup /usr/share/elasticsearch & kibana also with below cmd
cd /usr/share/
cp elasticsearch elascticsearch_bkp
cp kibana kibana_bkp

And need to take the backup of service file also logstash,kibana & elasticsearch service files withe below cmd
cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
cp logstash.service logstash.service_bkp
cp kibana.service kibana.service_bkp
cp elasticsearch.service elasticsearch.service_bkp

so, we took bkp for all the service files

First we have to took a logstash to upgrade first on logstash server's

After taking backup upgrade the logstash with below cmd

rpm -Uvh logstash-8.*.*-x86_64.rpm

after upgrade command restart & enable the service
systemctl restart logstash
systemctl status logstash
systemctl enable logstash

Completion of these steps the logstash is running successfull.

Now we proceed for upgrade with the latest rpm upgraded file with the cmd given below
rpm -Uvh elasticsearch-8.*.*-x86_64.rpm

After running the upgrade cmd we have to restart the service.
systemctl restart elasticsearch

The service is down i think so.we have to create a directory with two files
create the directory on the below path

cd /usr/lib/systemd/system/
mkdir elasticsearch.service.d
cd elasticsearch.service.d
touch override.conf
touch startup-timeout.conf
cat override.conf
[Service]
LimitMEMLOCK=infinity

cat startup-timeout.conf
[Service]
#TimeoutStartSec=180
TimeoutStartSec=300
NotifyAccess=all

After creating these two files restart the es service
systemctl restart elascticsearch

check the status & enable the service
systemctl status elascticsearch
systemctl enable elascticsearch

Do the same thing with datanodes one by one & then go on with mn 2 then after mn 1
After upgrading elascticsearch service of all the node of clusters then upgrade the kibana on nodes where the service is running with below cmd

rpm -Uvh kibana-8.*.*-x86_64.rpm

After that took restart the kibana & enable it
systemctl restart kibana
systemctl status kibana
systemctl enable kibana

If in case kibana URL is not working follow the below step.

After the upgrade completion of elascticsearch & kibana service on all the nodes of elk cluister restart those services together on all nodes with ansible cmd.
ansible -i <file name> all -m shekk -a "systemctl status kibana & elasticsearch" -b.
